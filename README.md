# shelfstockanalysis
This project aims to classify the beer bottle stacked upon the shelf, get information from the tags on the shelf i.e. which beer does it correspond to and what is its price and then find out whether the tag corresponds to the recommended price or not.

We have used OpenCV for Python and C++, Tessarect and NLTK for the implementation.
